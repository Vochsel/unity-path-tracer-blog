        <h3>Presentation Preparation</h3>
        <p>
            For this Software Development 4 subject I had to create and present an in person presentation that outlined my research and a demonstration of my created software artefact. This was an exciting opportunity for me and allowed me to really polish everything up and present it to my peers. I'm very happy with the progress that I completed and the results were all very promising. Despite having to miss out on some initial goals, the artefact I created this semester is very indicative of the initial goals and purposes that I had for the research paper. It fully showcases the use cases and opportunities that it can bring to an artists workflow in creating stunning 3D images.

            I think the presentation went fairly well, I was able to present and showcase the tool and important research areas that I had studied. I wasn't sure of time restrictions so I didn't get to demo the tool live in Unity like I had planned, but I played a video I prepared earlier which showcased each of the important features.

        <h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
        <p>
            At this point, I've tidied my code, and created some installation instructions to accompany my artefact submission. I exported it all as a <b>*.unitypackage</b> file which allows for easy installation into other Unity projects. I know have just a few things to write about in my research paper and then I'll be finished with that as well. 
        </p>

            Overall I'm very happy with the results I was able to achieve and am very excited and reassured of the future possibilities of such a tool. During my research Unity announced a partnership with OTOY and their Octane renderer which offers similar ideals to my research paper, which only reassures that there is a public interest in such a tool.

        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>
            After this subject is complete, I plan on further implementing some of the features I missed out on implementing for the assignment and hopefully releasing it in some form to the public. I could go open source and get lots of people to help contribute and share around the plugin, or I could release it as a paid asset on the Unity store. Either way I'd love to get it into the hands of actual developers and hear their feedback and opinions to help make this tool really useful and successful.

            This is likely to be my last blog post on this website, but if I decide to continue development I'm likely to keep this updated with any future news.
