        <h3>Issues Faced</h3>
        <p>
            In the last two weeks I solved the triangle rendering problems I was having previously, however encountered an additional problem. I had been "Brue Forcing" all of the triangles at once. This came with significant performance issues and meant incredibly slow and unresponsive workflows.

        <p>
            I then spent several days looking into potential fixes and acceleration structures that could be used to optimize performance. After trying to implement several, I came to a difficult decision where I felt that it would be better to not support triangular meshes in favour of having a fast and interactable experience with simple primitive shapes, such as the Sphere, Plane, and Box.

            From there, I spent the next week implementing planes, better materials, a much nicer Unity UI, and the ability to export renders to a file. I'm quite happy with the progress I've made for this artefact, however there are several features I'd like to add, and I'd also like to clean up my code significantly. From here however the most important task is to complete the accompanying Research paper for the Software Development 4 subject. Originally this paper was going to focus more on different Path Tracing techniques, however I feel more comfortable now writing about the integration with Unity 3D and their Compute Shaders. This was a fairly undocumented area of research that I found creating this artefact and could do with some formalised research and development.

        <h3>Weekly Render Showcase</h3>
        <p>
            Here is a selection of renders from this week which were exported using the new Export to PNG feature. This will help document and show the evolution of the renderer.
